# Winter Game Jam 2022
This project is built during the 14-day-long [Winter Game Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-winter-2022). We would like to thank the organizers of this event for giving us the opportunity on working on a Game Jam with a quite unique theme this time around: Nature.

The game itself is a simple Rhythm Game where you play as a Mochi / Nature Spirit who is navigating through and endless valley, bringing nature to wherever it passes. However, the path through the valley is incredibly treacherous, appearing and disappearing following the beat of a song.

## Unique Systems
This game has unique systems build for this game and this game only.

### Procedurally Generated Paths
Each playthrough is unique; the game will generate different paths every time you play. The only similar thing would be the beat of the music that you have to follow. These paths are tailored specifically not to run into each other.

### Unique Color Palette Generation
Each playthrough also has a unique color palette generated on game start. The theme will depend on the difficulty you're choosing, but will always be unique; Easy will have more-purplish or pinkish tones, Normal will have lime to yellow variations, and so on.

### Chaotic Controls
You would normally move in the 4 directions using the keys WASD. However, as you progress further through the sea of tiles, or at higher difficulties, you might notice some items that will change your controls. W, once the direction for up, might become Q instead. How well will your brain adapt?

## Afterword
All in all, thank you for playing and/or downloading this game. If you can spare the time, leave a comment at the itch.io page over here too! [Link Coming Soon]
