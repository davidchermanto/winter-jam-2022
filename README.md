# Winter Game Jam 2022
This project is built during [Winter Game Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-winter-2022). We would like to thank the organizers of this event for giving us the opportunity on working on a Game Jam with a quite unique theme this time around: Nature.

The game is a simple Rhythm Game where you play as a Mochi / Nature Spirit who is navigating through an endless valley, bringing life to wherever it passes. However, the path through the valley is incredibly treacherous, tiles appear and disappear following the beat of a song.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, leave a star on this repository!

## Unique Features
This game has unique systems built for this game and this game only.

### Procedurally Generated Paths
Each playthrough is unique; the game will generate different paths every time you play. The only similar thing would be the beat of the music that you have to follow. These paths are tailored specifically not to run into each other.

### Rhythm Sync
There are 3 difficulties with their own unique song and increasing BPM. The timing bar follows the BPM of the song precisely, never going out of sync even during lags.

### Unique Color Palette Generation
Each playthrough also has a unique color palette generated on game start. The theme will depend on the difficulty you're choosing, but will always be unique; Easy will have more-purplish or pinkish tones, Normal will have lime to yellow variations, and so on.

I drew up the initial concept art for the game during the first day of the jam. It surprisingly does not look far off from the final result!

### Chaotic Controls
You would normally move in the 4 directions using the keys WASD. However, as you progress further through the sea of tiles, or at higher difficulties, you might notice some items that will change your controls. For example, the direction for up, W, might become Q instead. How well will your brain adapt?

### Combo
When you follow a beat correctly, you might be awarded with the Perfect! or Good grade. This multiplies the points you earn, based on the length of the combo and the accuracy. The longer the combo, the better your score is, so be careful not to lose your combos! Build up massive combos and earn the best high score.

### No External Plugins
All of the systems above are coded in-house within the time limit! The only plugins used in this project are Cinemachine and GitHub, for convenience.

## Afterword
All in all, thank you for playing and/or downloading this game. If you can spare the time, leave a comment or rate it at the [itch.io page](https://edenmystery.itch.io/mystical-valley) too!
